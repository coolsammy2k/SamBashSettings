# Linux Capabilities

When we run a pod in kubernetes it does not use Seccomp by default

To check which capabilites a command needs,run the command

$ getcaps /usr/bin/ping
  /usr/bin/ping = cap_net_raw+ep

To check the capabilites of a process use the command, for instance to find the capabilities of
of ssh process , first get the pid of the process and then use getpcaps

$ ps -ef | grep /usr/bin/sshd | grep -v grep
  root  779 1 0 03:55 ? 00:00:00 /usr/sbin/sshd

$ getpcaps  779


# Capabilites can be added or removed from a container as below
