Above pod definition has security risks as privileged and volume mounted as hostpath

We may want to Create Policies that prevent users/developer from creating containers with certain configurations, thats where Pod Security Policies come in
Pod Security Policies help in defining policies to restrict pods from being create with specific capabilities and previleges 

One of the Admission controller is PodSecurityPolicy which is a built in admission controller but not enabled by default

1. Enable the PodSecurityPolicy in kube-apiserver with enable-admission-plugins
2. Create an object of PodSecurityPolicy, refer below psp object psp.yaml
